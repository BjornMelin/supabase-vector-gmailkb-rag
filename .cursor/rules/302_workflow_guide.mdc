# Session Workflow Guide

This document explains how to manage workflow states and sessions in this project.

## Session Management

### Starting a New Session

1. **Create a new workflow state file**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp .cursor/rules/301_workflow_state_template.mdc .cursor/rules/301_workflow_state.mdc
   ```

2. **Customize for your session**:
   - Update the YAML front matter
   - Set the initial Phase and Status
   - Add project-specific rules if needed
   - Update the log with session start

3. **Begin working on tasks**: The workflow state file will be updated as you progress

### Ending a Session

1. **Archive your session state**:
   ```bash
   # Create a dated copy in the sessions directory
   cp .cursor/rules/301_workflow_state.mdc .cursor/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_task-name_workflow_state.mdc
   ```

2. **Update metadata**:
   - Set `alwaysActive: false` in the archived file
   - Set `priority: 0` in the archived file to avoid cluttering the UI

3. **Persist key information**:
   ```python
   # Use memory_mcp to store important insights
   memory_mcp.add_observations({
     "entityName": "project_milestone",
     "contents": ["Session completed: task-name", "Key outcome 1", "Key outcome 2"]
   })
   ```

## Multiple Sessions

For concurrent work on different tasks:

1. **Use branch-specific workflow states**:
   - Create a feature branch for each task
   - Each branch maintains its own workflow state

2. **Switch between tasks**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/task-a   # Switch to task A
   # Work on task A using its workflow state
   
   git checkout feat/task-b   # Switch to task B
   # Work on task B using its workflow state
   ```

## Session File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_task-name_workflow_state.mdc
```

Example:
```
2025-04-28_gmail-api-auth_workflow_state.mdc
```

## Integration with Memory

- Use `memory_mcp` to persist key milestones, decisions, and learnings
- Reference previous session files when needed for context
- Keep the current session's workflow state active and updated

## Workflow State Sections

Each workflow state file contains these key sections:

1. **State**: Current phase and status of the task
2. **Plan**: Detailed implementation plan (after ANALYZE phase)
3. **Rules**: Guidelines for the current phase and task
4. **Log**: Chronological record of actions and decisions
5. **Current Phase Details**: Specific information about the active phase

Always update these sections to maintain an accurate record of progress.
